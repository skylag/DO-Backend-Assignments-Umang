Answers of Theoratical Assignement - Phase 1

TYPESCRIPT

Ans 1 : Only 1 tsconfig.json file is present in backend section of Klient
Ans 2 : The strict subrules used are : "alwaysStrict" , "noImplicitAny", "noImplicitThis", "strictNullChecks".
Ans 3 : The following paths are excluded -  ["**/*.spec.ts", "src/documentation-server/**", "src/test/**"]
Ans 4 : The typescript keywords I came across are : const, import, export, await, enums, extends, sync, try, catch, throw, public , private, implements, from, etc.

GIT

Ans 1 : I learned about Git Rebasing here, Klient uses Git Rebasing before merging pull requests. 
Ans 2 : After a pull request has made, an automated checking occurs and if it passes, then only it is ready to be merged into the main branch. If a conflict occurs, then different techniques are applied to resolve the same.
